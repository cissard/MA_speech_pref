\abstract{
The human auditory system is amazingly efficient at processing speech,
with a preference for these sounds reported by full term birth. More
generally, infants tested at a variety of ages have been presented with
contrasts between native or foreign speech and another sound, which may
be vocal or not, natural or not. These data constitute a rich pool of
evidence that can be sourced from to assess to what extent familiarity,
vocal quality, and naturalness affect speech preference across
development. We synthesized the literature by conducting a meta-analysis
of studies testing speech preference in infants from birth to one year
of age. We found a medium effect size, with infants preferring speech
over other sounds. This preference was not significantly moderated by
familiarity, vocal quality, or naturalness. We found no effect of age:
infants showed the same strength of preference throughout the first year
of life. Speech therefore appears to be preferred from birth, even to
other natural or vocal sounds. These results contradict current views of
the literature, and call for further investigation of the phenomenon,
especially in older infants.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Given the importance of speech for human vocal communication, it is
conceivable that infants are born equipped with a preference for speech,
which becomes stronger with age and exposure. Here, we synthesize
empirical data on infants' preferences for speech over non-speech sounds
to assess the explanatory role of three factors: stimulus naturalness,
vocal quality, and familiarity.

\subsection{Potential dimensions underlying preference
patterns}\label{potential-dimensions-underlying-preference-patterns}

There are three key conceptual explanations for infants preference for
speech over competitor sounds: Preference for (a) natural over
artificial sounds; (b) familiar over unfamiliar sounds; and (c) vocal
over non-vocal sounds (Figure 1). These explanations are mutually
compatible, and one or more may be true.

\subsubsection{Naturalness}\label{naturalness}

A first hypothesis postulates a preference for natural over artificial
sounds. Natural sounds are those produced by biological systems,
including vocal tracts but also the sound of walking and heart rate. In
many cases natural and artificial sounds differ in their acoustic
characteristics. For example, backward speech has unnatural formant
transitions and seemingly abrupt closures compared to naturally produced
sounds. Natural sounds are processed more efficiently by the auditory
system, from the cochlea (Smith \& Lewicki, 2006) to the auditory cortex
(e.g., Mizrahi, Shalev, \& Nelken, 2014). This predicts a preference for
speech over artificial competitors that is present from birth,
consistent with existing literature (e.g., Vouloumanos \& Werker, 2007).

\subsubsection{Familiarity}\label{familiarity}

Perhaps infants prefer speech to other sounds since it is a frequent
sound. Newborns prefer their native speech to prosodically distinct
foreign speech (e.g., Mehler et al., 1988), which supports a preference
for sound patterns heard frequently in the womb. There are no behavioral
results directly testing the prediction that infants show stronger
preferences for speech over a foil when tested with more familiar speech
stimuli (for instance, spoken in their native, as compared to a foreign
language), but results from neuroimaging studies provide indirect
evidence for this view. For instance, newborns' brain activation was
different for forward than backward speech when the native language was
used as the speech stimuli, but not when a foreign language was used
(May, Gervain, Carreiras, \& Werker, 2018).

\subsubsection{Vocal quality}\label{vocal-quality}

Many results summarized above may be accommodated by a third hypothesis,
postulating a preference for vocal over non-vocal sounds. Vocal sounds
are those made with a mouth, and thus typically a subset of natural
sounds\footnote{In the case of filtered speech, the modulations
  introduced by the vocal tract are still present at the retained
  frequencies. For this reason, filtered speech can be considered as
  vocal but not natural.}. Newborns made more head-turns to speech than
to heartbeat (Ecklund-Flores \& Turkewitz, 1996), arguably both equally
natural and familiar to them, but they listened equivalently to speech
and monkey calls, despite the greater familiarity of the former
(Vouloumanos, Hauser, Werker, \& Martin, 2010).

\subsection{Changes as a function of
development}\label{changes-as-a-function-of-development}

Development may affect the preference for speech in various ways.
Whereas newborns do not prefer speech over monkey calls,
three-month-olds do (Vouloumanos et al., 2010). This suggests that as
they age, infants might develop an increasingly narrow definition of the
stimulus they prefer. In this case naturalness, familiarity, and vocal
quality effects should change as a function of age: Very close stimuli
(e.g., speech versus another natural sound) initially leads to a weak
preference, but, as infants age, this preference may be as strong as
that found for very different stimuli (e.g., speech versus an artificial
sound). Many articles discuss potential changes in the pattern of
preference as a function of age (e.g. Ferry, Hespos, \& Waxman, 2013;
Shultz \& Vouloumanos, 2010; Shultz, Vouloumanos, Bennett, \& Pelphrey,
2014). To our knowledge, only two papers from the same laboratory
include multiple age groups tested with the exact same stimulus
categories and procedure (Vouloumanos \& Werker, 2004; Vouloumanos et
al., 2010). In fact, statements about age-related changes are often done
using the demonstrably problematic method of concluding that there is an
interaction without actually testing for it statistically (Gelman \&
Stern, 2006). It is therefore important to directly test these
statements.

\subsection{A meta-analytic approach}\label{a-meta-analytic-approach}

In sum, previous work on infants' preferences is broadly compatible with
preference for natural over artificial, vocal over non-vocal, and
familiar over unfamiliar sounds, potentially interacting with infants'
age. In this paper, we seek to directly test these interpretations of
the literature by employing a meta-analytic approach. Meta-analyses
involve combining studies that may vary in their methodology. One
limitation is therefore that one cannot isolate specific variables as
well as in direct experimentation. Therefore, meta-analyses may miss
subtle effects. Nonetheless, they have several useful features. They can
reveal small effects not obvious in individual studies by combining them
to obtain larger samples. Additionally, by integrating data across
different laboratories, they provide evidence for the generalizability
of effects across labs. Finally, meta-analyses offer tools to detect
publication bias in the literature.

Specifically for the present case, a meta-analysis allows to
statistically test different explanations. We can test the effect of
factors that are not part of the original design, by redescribing the
stimuli used as a function of those factors. For instance, a study
measuring preference for native speech over native backward speech
provides data on a natural versus artificial, as well as a vocal versus
non-vocal contrast. We can also draw a developmental timeline across the
age range covered by the literature.

Meta-analyses can even provide theoretical and empirical insights that
contradict qualitative reviews. For example, it has been proposed that
infants' preference for novel or familiar items related to infants' age
such that, all things equal, younger infants showed familiarity
preferences whereas older infants exhibited novelty preferences (Hunter
\& Ames, 1988). However, Bergmann and Cristia (2016) found stable
familiarity preferences for word segmentation in natural speech across
the first two years; and Black and Bergmann (2017) found a stable
novelty effect for artificial grammars implemented in synthesized
speech, whereas those implemented in natural speech led to stable
familiarity preferences. Meta-analyses are therefore important to
statistically and systematically test the theoretical predictions
proposed in qualitative reviews.

\subsection{The present study}\label{the-present-study}

Given the scarcity of direct evidence on the potential explanations laid
out above (naturalness, vocal quality, and familiarity, as a function of
age), we conducted a meta-analysis to test whether infants' preference
for speech sounds over other types of sounds is stable in newborns, and
how it develops over the first year of life. Assuming all three factors
are true, and further assuming that the definition of the preferred
stimulus narrows with age, we predicted that infants will show (see
Figure 2):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a greater preference for speech over natural sounds as a function of
  age, but a stable preference for speech over artificial sounds that is
  stable over development;
\item
  a greater preference for speech over other vocal sounds as a function
  of age, but a stable preference for speech over non-vocal sounds over
  development;
\item
  a greater preference for native speech over non-speech as a function
  of age, but a smaller preference for foreign speech over non-speech
  with age.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Literature search}\label{literature-search}

We composed the initial list of studies with suggestions by experts
(authors of this work); one google scholar searches ( (\enquote{speech
preference} OR \enquote{own-species vocalization}) AND infant -
\enquote{infant-directed} ), the same search in PubMed and PsycInfo
(last searches on 24/09/2019); and a google alert. We also inspected the
reference lists of all included papers.

\subsection{Inclusion criteria}\label{inclusion-criteria}

After a first screening based on titles and abstracts using more liberal
inclusion criteria, we decided on inclusion based on full paper reading.
We included studies that tested human infants from birth to 1 year of
age, and contrasted speech sounds with any other type of sound,
measuring behavioral responses to the sounds (e.g., looking times). We
excluded studies that only contrasted foreign against native language,
did not present natural speech sounds at all, presented speech in the
mother's voice, or intentionally mixed speech with other vocal sounds
within the same sound condition. We also excluded neuroimaging studies
to avoid mixing results from different brain regions with different
response profiles. We included published (i.e., journal articles) as
well as unpublished works (i.e., doctoral dissertations as long as
sufficient information was provided).

A PRISMA flow chart summarizes the literature review and selection
process (Figure 3). We documented all the studies that we inspected in a
decision spreadsheet (available in the online supplementary materials;
\href{https://osf.io/4stz9/?view_only=d0696591ebf34bfc8430f848cd945ca8}{Anonymized
link, 2019}).

\subsection{Coding}\label{coding}

The critical variables for our purpose are infant age, methodological
variables (testing method: central fixation, high amplitude sucking,
head-turn preference procedure, high amplitude sucking/passive
listening), and key stimuli characteristics. Specifically, we coded the
language in which the speech sounds were recorded (native or foreign),
and whether the sound opposed to speech was natural or not, vocal or
not. This competitor was coded as natural if it was produced by a
biological organism without any further acoustic manipulation. If the
authors applied acoustic manipulations it was coded as artificial. This
sound was considered as vocal if it was produced by an animal vocal
tract, either original or modified.

Data were coded by the first author. In addition, 20\% of the papers
were randomly selected to be coded by the second author independently,
with disagreements resolved by discussion. There were 10 disagreements
out of a total of 260 fields filled in indicative of the coders not
following the codebook, which led to a revision of all data in four
variables.

We coded all the statistical information reported in the included
papers. If reported, we coded the mean score and the standard deviation
for speech, and the other sound separately. When infant-level data was
provided, we recomputed the respective mean scores and standard
deviations based on the reported individual scores. If reported, we also
coded the t-statistic between the two sound conditions, or an
F-statistic provided this was a two-way comparison. If effect sizes were
directly reported as a Cohen's d or a Hedges' g, we also coded this.

The PRISMA checklist, data, and code can be found on the online
supplementary materials
(\href{https://osf.io/4stz9/?view_only=d0696591ebf34bfc8430f848cd945ca8}{Anonymized},
2019).

\subsection{Effect sizes}\label{effect-sizes}

Once the data were coded, we extracted effect sizes, along with their
respective variance. Effect sizes were standardized differences (Cohen's
d) between response to speech and to the other sound. If they were not
directly reported in the papers, we computed them using the respective
means and SDs (Lipsey \& Wilson, 2001), or a t- or F-statistic (Dunlap,
Cortina, Vaslow, \& Burke, 1996). As our effect sizes came from
within-subject comparisons (e.g.~looking time of the same infant during
speech and during monkey calls), we needed to take into account the
correlation between the two measurements in effect sizes and effect size
variances computations. We computed this correlation based on the
t-statistic, the respective means and SDs (Lipsey \& Wilson, 2001) if
they were all reported; or imputed this correlation randomly if not. We
finally calculated the variance of each effect size (Lipsey \& Wilson,
2001). Cohen's d were transformed to Hedges' g by multiplying d by a
correction for small sample sizes based on the degree of freedom
(Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, \& Rothstein, 2011). This procedure led to
47 (some of them coming from the same infant group, hence not mutually
independent) effect sizes, 46 from published, peer-reviewed paper, and 1
from a thesis.

All analyses use the R (R Core Team, 2018) package Robumeta (Hedges,
Tipton, \& Johnson, 2010), which allows to fit meta-analytic regressions
that take into account the correlated structure of the data, when
repeated measures are obtained from the same infant groups within
papers.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Database description}\label{database-description}

We found a total of 15 papers reporting 47 (not mutually independent)
effect sizes, see Figure 4. 14 papers have been submitted to or
published in peer-reviewed journals (Colombo \& Bundy, 1981; Cooper \&
Aslin, 1994; Curtin \& Vouloumanos, 2013; Ecklund-Flores \& Turkewitz,
1996; Segal \& Kishon-Rabin, 2011; Shultz \& Vouloumanos, 2010;
Sorcinelli, Ference, Curtin, \& Vouloumanos, 2019; Spence \& DeCasper,
1987; Vouloumanos \& Curtin, 2014; Vouloumanos \& Werker, 2004, 2007;
Vouloumanos, Druhen, Hauser, \& Huizink, 2009; Vouloumanos et al., 2010,
2010; Yamashiro, Curtin, \& Vouloumanos, 2019). The remaining 1 paper
was a thesis (J. D. Ference, 2018).

Studies tended to have small sample sizes, with a median N of 16
children (Range = 52, M = 20.66, Total: 659). Infants ranged from 0 to
12 months (1.50 to 380.50 days), although the majority were under 9
months of age (66.67\% of the studies). Individual samples comprised 48
\% of female participants on average. Infants were native of 6 different
languages across the whole database (English, French, Russian, Yiddish,
Hebrew, Italian). Studies were performed in 10 different laboratories
from 4 different countries (United States, Canada, Israel, Italy). 3
experimental methods were used: 12 studies used Central Fixation (CF)
(Colombo \& Bundy, 1981; Cooper \& Aslin, 1994; Curtin \& Vouloumanos,
2013; J. D. Ference, 2018; Segal \& Kishon-Rabin, 2011; Shultz \&
Vouloumanos, 2010; Sorcinelli et al., 2019; Vouloumanos \& Curtin, 2014;
Vouloumanos \& Werker, 2004; Vouloumanos et al., 2009, 2010; Yamashiro
et al., 2019); 3 used High-Amplitude Sucking (HAS) (Spence \& DeCasper,
1987; Vouloumanos \& Werker, 2007; Vouloumanos et al., 2010) ; and 1
used Head-turn Preference Procedure (HPP) (Ecklund-Flores \& Turkewitz,
1996).

\subsection{Summary effect size}\label{summary-effect-size}

Integrating across all studies in a meta-analytic regression without any
moderator, we found a summary effect size g of 0.53 (SE = 0.09, CI =
{[}0.34 , 0.73{]}) (Table 1, and Figure 4, diamond), corresponding to a
medium effect size.

\subsection{Publication bias}\label{publication-bias}

We assessed the presence of a potential publication bias in the body of
literature by studying the relationship between standard errors of
effect sizes as a function of Hedges' g (see funnel plot in Figure
5)\footnote{If the literature is not biased, effect sizes should be
  evenly distributed around the mean effect size, with increasing
  standard error as they go away from the mean effect size (both in the
  positive and negative directions, white triangle in the funnel plot).
  This is reflected by a symmetrical funnel plot, with no linear
  relationship between effect sizes and standard errors.}. A regression
test on these data was significant (z = 6.70, p = 0.00), as was the
Kendall's tau rank correlation test for funnel plot asymmetry (Kendall's
tau = 0.53, p = 0.00), indicating a publication bias in the literature.
To further investigate this bias, we symmetrized the funnel plot with
the \enquote{trim and fill} method (Duval \& Tweedie, 2000). 12 (SE =
4.08) missing studies were needed on the left side of the plot to
symmetrize the funnel plot.

\subsection{Moderator analyses}\label{moderator-analyses}

We then tested if the preference found above could be explained by the
dimensions discussed in the literature. Following our hypothesis, we fit
a meta-analytic model with the following moderators:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  mean age of children;
\item
  familiarity with the language used (native or foreign);
\item
  naturalness of the contrastive sound (coded as yes if it was natural
  and no otherwise);
\item
  vocal quality of the contrastive sound (coded as yes if it was vocal
  and no otherwise).
\end{itemize}

None of the moderators was significant (see Figure 6 and Table 1).

\begin{table}[tbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{threeparttable}
\caption{\label{tab:Table1}Statistical results of meta-regression with all main effects. The estimates correspond to changes in the intercept when the target stimuli are in the native language (familiarity); the competitor is artificial (naturalness); and the competitor is non-vocal (vocal quality).}
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\toprule
 & estimate & SE & t & confidence interval & \\
\midrule
summary effect size & 0.53 & 0.09 & 5.65 & 0.34 & 0.73\\
familiarity & 0.14 & 0.24 & 0.61 & -0.39 & 0.68\\
naturalness & -0.03 & 0.27 & -0.10 & -0.63 & 0.58\\
vocal quality & -0.12 & 0.27 & -0.46 & -0.75 & 0.50\\
age & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.34 & 0.00 & 0.00\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Due to the relatively low number of effect sizes available in the
literature, we did not add interactions with age to the model to avoid
overfitting. Inspection of results in Figure 5 show that the confidence
intervals of all conditions overlap almost exactly across the tested
ages, excluding the possibility of such interactions.

Readers may wonder to what extent our results are obscured by the
influence of experimental method, which is known to be sizable in the
cognitive developmental literature (Bergmann et al., 2018). Inspection
of plots where effect sizes has been residualized from experimental
method (Supplementary figure S1) looks virtually identical.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our meta-analysis synthesizes the available literature on infants'
preference for speech sounds. Our results confirm that infants reliably
prefer speech over other types of sounds from birth. When all studies
were considered together with no moderators, we found a sizable
intercept (g=0.53). For comparison, the main effect for native vowel
discrimination using looking time methods is estimated at 0.25 (Tsuji \&
Cristia, 2014, data inspected in \url{http://metalab.stanford.edu} on
2019-10-18). We had predicted infants' speech preference to be larger
when the competitor was an artificial sound than when it was a natural
one; when the competitor was non-vocal; and when the speech was in the
infants' native language. In fact, we were unable to disprove the null
hypothesis of no difference for all three factors, with widely
overlapping distributions of effect sizes for studies varying along the
three dimensions.

We had also hypothesized age to play a major role, because it may
correlate with a reshaping of the category definition for speech itself.
Indeed, studies comparing processing of human speech against human
non-speech as well as animal vocalizations more generally (McDonald et
al., 2019; Vouloumanos et al., 2010) often discuss these age-related
differences in categorization of these sounds. Surprisingly, age did not
significantly moderate the overall preference for speech.

From birth and regardless of changes co-occurring with age, infants show
a preference for speech, which cannot be reduced to three simpler
explanations: naturalness, vocalness, or familiarity (represented here
by the native/foreign contrast). This capacity to preferentially listen
to speech sounds from birth suggests that infants are born with the
capacity to recognize their conspecifics' communication signals. This
parallels what has been proposed by the Conspec model for faces: infants
would be born with knowledge about faces, enabling them to orient their
attention toward them, even without any prior exposure to faces (Morton
\& Johnson, 1991). The fact that familiarity with the language used in
the experiment did not modulate infants' preference suggests that
exposure did not play a crucial role for speech either. However,
contrary to faces, fetuses are exposed to speech that is low-pass
filtered by the womb throughout the last trimester of gestation
(Lecanuet \& Granier-Deferre, 1993; Querleu, Renard, Versyp,
Paris-Delrue, \& Crèpin, 1988). It is therefore possible that prenatal
experience with low-pass filtered speech helps infants to form a
representation of speech, independently of the language spoken.

The Conspec model proposes that faces would be detected because of their
spatial structure (Morton \& Johnson, 1991). Similarly, it is possible
that infants prefer speech because of its complex acoustic structure and
fast transitions (Rosen \& Iverson, 2007). Speech is characterized by
joint spectral and temporal modulations at specific rates (Singh \&
Theunissen, 2003). It is possible that infants attune to this specific
spectro-temporal structure (though see Minagawa-Kawai, Cristià,
Vendelin, Cabrol, \& Dupoux, 2011, for evidence that these factors taken
separately may not be sufficient for neural responses). Testing this
explanation would require to carry out acoustic analyses of the actual
stimuli used in the studies. Thus, we recommend interested researchers
to gather more data in which the competitor is acoustically simple
versus complex; and to deposit the actual stimuli in a public archive
such as the Open Science Framework (Foster \& Deardorff, 2017).

One may wonder whether we fail to find many differences because of a
lack of statistical power, particularly in view of between-study
variability. We think it is unlikely that all null results reported in
this paper are due to this. Inspection of results in Figure 6 show that
the confidence intervals of all conditions overlap almost exactly.
Moreover, Table 1 shows that the estimate for all these factors is close
to zero (the maximum being 0.14). That said, more data would be welcome
to confirm our results with more statistical power. It would also be
important to carry out more tests on infants older than 9 months.
Language production gains in complexity at about this age (Oller,
Eilers, Neal, \& Schwartz, 1999), which could affect infants' speech
preference. We particularly recommend using as competitor natural vocal
stimuli, and as target foreign speech, which would help fill in an
important gap in our dataset.

Another finding of our meta-analysis is that the distribution of effect
sizes in the literature is consistent with publication bias, in view of
a strong asymmetry of the funnel plot. In fact, the trim-and-fill method
suggested 12 points may be missing, which is a considerable number given
that we have 47 effect sizes in total (i.e., a quarter more would be
missing). Unsurprisingly, the missing studies are in the negative
section, i.e., a preference \emph{against} speech, a result that could
lead authors to doubt their own data and not submit it to journals, or
that would be considered odd by reviewers and editors, who may ask that
the data be removed (or who may recommend the paper to be rejected
altogether). These missing studies constitute an important limitation of
our results. The literature being biased toward positive effect sizes,
the true effect size might be smaller than the one we found (vertical
line on Figure 5).

Ultimately, preferential processing of speech may support higher level
cognitive tasks. The human species is a highly social one. Detecting
speech signals would allow to integrate it with other sensory percepts,
such as faces, to form multisensory representations of conspecifics
(Vouloumanos et al., 2009). This would lay the track for social
cognition. Identifying speech signals and paying attention to them would
allow infants to form complex representations of the sensory world, that
they can manipulate cognitively. Infants could categorize visual stimuli
(i.e.~associate a label to a category of objects) when they were
associated to speech, but not pure tones or backward speech (Ferry,
Hespos, \& Waxman, 2010; Ferry et al., 2013; Fulkerson \& Waxman, 2007).
Interestingly, infants categorized visual stimuli when presented with
speech, melodies, or monkey vocalizations (Ferry et al., 2013; Fulkerson
\& Haaf, 2003). These results support the idea that infants may
preferentially process complex sounds. Finally, the preference itself
may also be a meaningful index of processing that can be used to
identify children at risk (Sorcinelli et al., 2019). It is therefore
important to take stock of what we know today.

Given the crucial importance of understanding infants' speech
preference, we make the following recommendations for further data
collection, analysis, and reporting. First, authors should strive to
increase their sample sizes. The median sample size at present is 20,
which is close to the field standard (Bergmann et al., 2018) but much
lower than current recommendations (Oakes, 2017). Second, authors should
consider proposing their studies as registered reports (Kiyonaga \&
Scimeca, 2019). In this new publication scheme (available for
Developmental Science, Infancy, Infant Behavior and Development, and
Journal of Child Language at the time of writing, see a full up-to-date
list on \url{https://cos.io/rr/}), manuscripts are submitted before data
are collected. Reviewers and editors make publication decisions based
solely on the introduction and methods. Once the paper is accepted, the
author collects the data, analyses it according to a pipeline described
in the accepted methods, and writes up the rest of the manuscript. The
paper is then reviewed once more for readability, but it cannot be
rejected if the results are surprising or uncomfortable for the field.
Third, for authors who would rather not follow this publication route,
we still strongly recommend the use of pre-specified analysis plans.
These have the virtue of, when used correctly, allowing both authors and
readers to separate confirmation from exploration, reducing the
likelihood of inadvertently engaging in questionable research practices
(Simmons, Nelson, \& Simonsohn, 2011), known to increase false
positives. Finally, we strongly recommend reviewers and editors to
evaluate submitted manuscripts on the basis of the quality of the
methods, and not of the results. If a study fails to report a speech
preference, or actually reports a preference for the competitor, this
may actually reflect the reality of this phenomenon. For interested
readers who intend to collect such data, we recommend caution when
designing the study, and transparency when reporting it. Our dataset can
be community-augmented, and we invite researchers investigating this
phenomenon to complement it with any data they would have
(\href{https://osf.io/4stz9/?view_only=d0696591ebf34bfc8430f848cd945ca8}{Anonymized
